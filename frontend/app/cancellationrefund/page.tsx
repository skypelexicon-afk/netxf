              <strong>All Sales Are Final:</strong> All purchases made on our
              platform (including courses, subscriptions, and bundled offers)
              are final. <strong>No refunds or cancellations</strong> will be issued under any
              circumstances after payment is completed.

            <li>
              <strong>Immediate Access to Content:</strong> Once payment is

              materials. This access constitutes full delivery of the service,
              and therefore, refunds are not applicable.
